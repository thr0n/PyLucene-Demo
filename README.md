# PyLucene-Demo

Just a simple PyLucene Demo.

## Notes:
- Python v2.x (with x >= 3.5) is required (see: (http://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/))
- ... and Python v3.x seems not to be supported.
- This demo has been tested only with Python 2.7.11 and PyLucene 4.9.0
- Extensive input files can be obtained from http://www.gutenberg.org/

This application is ispired by the PyLucene 4.9.0 sample's and several blogs and tutorials e.g.:
